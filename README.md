# ConcreteGAM

Using a public dataset of Concrete experimental data I have created a generalized additive model (GAM) to identify any non linear relationships between the variables. 

This repo includes a code segment that loaded the data, pre-processed it and created multiple ML models to identify trends.

A success criteria was then identified, and the most impactful model was analyzed in further detail on the attached report. 

The relevant data is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength.
